# 🤖 NAO Robot Behaviors

This repository contains a collection of behavior scripts, motion sequences, and interaction logic developed for the **NAO robot** using the NAOqi framework and Python.

All scripts were created during my **Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr (FSJ)** at the **Stadtteilbibliothek Buch** in Berlin, where I organized and conducted regular robotics workshops for children and library visitors. The project also includes motion sequences used in a **short film** featuring the NAO robot.

## 🧠 Key Highlights

- 📚 **Interactive storytelling** — NAO tells randomized fairy tales with gestures, posture changes, and synchronized speech using `ALAnimatedSpeech`  
- 🧠 **ChatGPT integration** — Real-time conversation between NAO and users powered by OpenAI’s API  
- ✋ **Custom gestures** — Scripts to control complex limb motions, including expressive hand, arm, and leg movements  
- 🚶 **Locomotion logic** — Python modules for controlled walking and posture transitions  
- 🎬 **Film choreography** — Motion sequences designed for scenes in an experimental NAO-centered film  
- 🎮 **Mini-game** — Rock–Paper–Scissors demo (included for completeness; not authored by me)
- 💃 **Dance routines** — Includes a disco dance and a slow meditation-style dance (*both created by third parties and integrated into the project*)

## 🎓 Background & Context

This work was part of my role in **digital education and robotics programming** at the Stadtteilbibliothek Buch. The goal was to introduce young participants to robotics, coding logic, and storytelling through real-world interaction with the NAO robot.

In addition to regular workshops, I developed scripts that allowed NAO to perform in a **narrative setting** — blending robotics and theater in a unique educational format.
